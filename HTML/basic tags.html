    <h1>Paragraph</h1>

    <p>HTML is a set of markup symbols or codes that tell web browsers how to display a page's content. HTML uses elements, which are enclosed by tags, to structure content. For example, the <p> element defines a paragraph, and the <html> element defines the whole document. 
        Meaning
        HTML provides semantics for documents, such as creating paragraphs, lists, and tables. 
        Display
        HTML markup can also be used to control how content is displayed, such as making words italicized, changing the font size, or creating hyperlinks. 
        Support
        HTML is supported by all major web browsers, including Chrome, Safari, and Mozilla. 
        Benefits
        HTML is beginner-friendly, open-source, and free. It's also easily integrable with other languages, such as PHP and Node.js. 
        HTML is a fundamental building block of the web, and is a formal recommendation by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).
